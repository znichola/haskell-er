# Get started with Haskell

Recode basic functions from the Prelude module and get to grips with the basics of hasekll and function programming.

It's structured like the classic exams, questions that get unlocked after solving a problem correctly, getting progressivly harder. There are two modes, completionist and regular mode with random selection of questions.

This was done with heavy use of the great [learn you a haskell](https://learnyouahaskell.github.io/) (for great good) so if you want a cheet sheet look there.
